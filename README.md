Learning and Growth

The main goal of this project is to familiarize myself with some basic Python concepts, and you can modify and experiment with the code to enhance your programming skills. Feel free to try different variations or add new features to expand your knowledge.

Future Plans

This project is just the beginning. I plan to expand on it by adding more complex topics such as:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Working with APIs

Data Analysis using Python
