# Python Learning Code

## Overview

This project is a collection of code snippets that I learned while studying the Python programming language. The code demonstrates basic concepts in Python such as sets and dictionaries, and how to use built-in functions like `issuperset`, `issubset`, and `clear`.

## Files

1. **File `main.py`:** Contains code that demonstrates the usage of sets and dictionaries.
   
   - **Sets:**
     - `issuperset`: Checks if one set contains another set.
     - `issubset`: Checks if one set is a subset of another set.

   - **Dictionaries:**
     - Shows how to add and update data in a dictionary.
     - Uses a two-dimensional dictionary to store multiple data.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   
2. Download or clone this project using Git:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository_name.git
